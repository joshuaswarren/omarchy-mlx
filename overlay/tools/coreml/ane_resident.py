"""Client for the resident ANE worker (plan sections 24-27, phase 8).

One supervised ``mlx-omarchy-ane-worker --serve`` process serves every
submit of a pass: each named bundle is parsed once, its programs are
loaded onto the device once, and they stay resident, so N island
submits cost one process launch, one bundle load, and one device load
instead of N of each.

This is not an inference server (section 25). There is no socket, no
listener, and no user-managed daemon: the worker is a private child of
this client, it only ever reads jobs from its own stdin, every submit is
bounded by the worker's wall-clock deadline, and a failure is reported
and ends the session -- never retried.

When ``MLX_OMARCHY_PK_KEEP_WORKER=1`` AND ``MLX_OMARCHY_ANE_SOCK`` is
set, the client first tries to attach to a long-running
``--daemon --socket PATH`` instance (which holds the device fd and
resident BOs across CLI invocations). On connect failure (no daemon,
stale socket, permission refusal, timeout) the client silently falls
back to the private-subprocess path above -- never hangs, never
escalates to the caller. The daemon, when present, owns the device and
the seal contract; the client never opens ``/dev/accel/accel0`` in this
mode.

Payloads travel inline on the worker stdin and stdout (private-subprocess
path) or the daemon's unix socket (daemon path). They do not go
through host files.
