// Bounded ANE worker boundary (plan sections 22-27).
//
// A worker run is a supervised child process: the child loads the
// validated bundle programs onto a device, executes the dispatch plan,
// reads results, releases the programs, and reports through a pipe. The
// parent enforces a wall-clock deadline; a deadline expiry or an
// abnormal child death leaves the device completion state uncertain, so
// the worker enters quarantine and refuses every later submission.
//
// This is not an inference server (section 25): one run() is one bounded
// execution of one bundle, nothing persists between runs except the
// quarantine state, and no listening socket or external request surface
// exists.
