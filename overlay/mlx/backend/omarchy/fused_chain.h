// unary/binary Compiled-tape nodes into ONE compute dispatch. The chain
// interpreter shader (shaders/fused_chain.comp) executes a packed
// instruction program with all intermediates in registers, so a
// k-op chain costs 1 dispatch instead of k. Honeykrisp register
// pressure stays at 8 scalars per invocation.
//
// Any node the chain cannot carry (unsupported op class, shape change,
// exotic broadcast, too many leaves, no tail dependency) makes the
// whole run fall back to the per-node tape path: loud refusal
// semantics are unchanged. bf16 nodes fuse through the chain's own
// bf16 kernels, which round every intermediate to the storage dtype
// exactly like per-node dispatch. The eager SwiGLU planner below keeps
// its own bf16 support with bf16 intermediate rounding.
//
// Fusion defaults on after exact-ID parity and paired performance validation on
// M1 hardware. MLX_OMARCHY_FUSED_CHAIN=0 restores the per-node path.
